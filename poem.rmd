## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->
’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
All mimsy were the borogoves,
      And the mome raths outgrabe.
“Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;
## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->
"The sun was shining on the sea,
      Shining with all his might:
He did his very best to make
      The billows smooth and bright —
And this was odd, because it was
      The middle of the night.

The moon was shining sulkily,
      Because she thought the sun
Had got no business to be there
      After the day was done —
"It's very rude of him," she said,
      "To come and spoil the fun."
## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->
In shadows deep, where whispers sigh,
Love's tender touch, where hearts comply.
A dance of souls in twilight's breath,
Embrace of life, entwined with death.

Through fleeting days and endless night,
Love's flame burns fierce, a guiding light.
Yet in the dusk, where shadows wane,
Death's gentle call, a solemn refrain.

In every kiss, a taste of fate,
Entwined in joy, in sorrow's weight.
For love and death, in sacred rhyme,
Weave threads of life, beyond all time.

In moments sweet, in tears that fall,
Love's melody, death's silent call.
For where one ends, the other starts,
Bound by destiny, entwined hearts.

So let us cherish, while we may,
The love that guides us, come what may.
For in the end, in final breath,
Love and death, they conquer death.
