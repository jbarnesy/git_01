In shadows deep, where whispers sigh,
Love's tender touch, where hearts comply.
A dance of souls in twilight's breath,
Embrace of life, entwined with death.

Through fleeting days and endless night,
Love's flame burns fierce, a guiding light.
Yet in the dusk, where shadows wane,
Death's gentle call, a solemn refrain.

In every kiss, a taste of fate,
Entwined in joy, in sorrow's weight.
For love and death, in sacred rhyme,
Weave threads of life, beyond all time.

In moments sweet, in tears that fall,
Love's melody, death's silent call.
For where one ends, the other starts,
Bound by destiny, entwined hearts.

So let us cherish, while we may,
The love that guides us, come what may.
For in the end, in final breath,
Love and death, they conquer death.
